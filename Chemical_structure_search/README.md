Substructure search
Substructure search of chemical compounds is a crucial tool in cheminformatics, enabling researchers to
identify and analyze chemical structures containing specific substructures. This method is widely applied in
various fields of chemistry, including drug discovery, materials science, and environmental research.
Substructure search helps scientists and engineers identify compounds with desired properties, predict
reactivity, and understand the mechanisms of chemical reactions.
Modern chemical compound databases contain millions of entries, making traditional search methods
inefficient and time-consuming. Substructure search utilizes algorithms that allow for quick and accurate
identification of compounds with specified structural fragments. These algorithms are based on graph
theory and the use of SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification) codes, ensuring high performance
and precision in the search process.

SMILES
A key element in the representation of chemical structures is the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry
System (SMILES). SMILES is a notation that allows a user to represent a chemical structure in a way that
can be easily processed by computers. It encodes molecular structures as a series of text strings, which
can then be used for various computational analyses, including substructure searches. The simplicity and
efficiency of SMILES make it a widely adopted standard in cheminformatics.
Here are some examples of SMILES notation:
Water (H₂O): O
Methane (CH₄): C
Ethanol (C₂H₅OH): CCO
Benzene (C₆H₆): c1ccccc1
Acetic acid (CH₃COOH): CC(=O)O
Aspirin (C₉H₈O₄): CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O
Examples of Substructure Search
Below are some examples of substructure searches with visual representations:

These examples illustrate how substructure searches can be used to find compounds containing specific
functional groups or structural motifs. By using SMILES notation and cheminformatics tools, researchers
can efficiently identify and study compounds of interest.
